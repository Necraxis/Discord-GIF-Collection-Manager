## üìö FAQ

**Q: Is this tool safe to use?**  
A: Yes! The tool runs entirely locally and uses official Discord APIs. Your token never leaves your device.

**Q: Can Discord detect this tool?**  
A: No. The tool uses the same API calls that Discord's client uses when you add or remove GIFs manually.

A: No. This tool doesn't violate Discord's Terms of Service as it only uses official API endpoints normally.

**Q: How do I share my GIF collection?**  
A: Use "Save Current Collection to Base64", then share the generated `.txt` file. Others can import it using "Replace Collection".
